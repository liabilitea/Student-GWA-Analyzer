# Student-GWA-Analyzer
***
## Description

This Python code reads a file containing a list of students and their GPAs, finds the student with the highest GWA, and displays their name. This is accomplished by looping through each line in the file, comparing the GWA of each student to the highest GPA currently in effect, and updating the variables as necessary. Lastly, it prints the name of the student with the highest GWA and their corresponding grades.

## How To Use / Run 

1. Install Python on your computer to run the code. You can download its latest version here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Create a text file called "studentgwalist.txt" containing a list of students and their GWAs in the format "Name - GWA" on each line.
3. Place the "numbers.txt" file in the same directory as the code file.
4. Copy the code from the repository. 
5. Open an IDE and paste the code.
    + If you don't have an IDE, you can use any text editor from your computer and paste the code. 
6. Save the file with a .py extension.
7. Run the code.
    + For text-editor users, open a command prompt or terminal window and locate the folder where the Python file was saved and enter the command provided below by typing it in the command-line interface. After typing the command, press the Enter key to execute.
    
  ```
  python 'file_name'.py
  ```
8. The code will read the "studentgwalist.txt" file, find the student with the highest GPA, and display their name.

## Example Output

  ```
  The student with the highest GWA of 1.0 is Joseph Buena
